## Idea
Orma, a memory journal app for early-stage dementia, lets users save memories via a WhatsApp bot and prompts them with retrieval cues, while caregivers can track user details through a companion website. 
An example scenario would be <br/>

Store Memories: Simply tell Orma about your experiences with a sentence like "I went to Bangalore and saw my son." <br/>
Recall Memories: When you forget a detail, ask Orma "I went to Bangalore and met someone. Who was it?"<br/>
Relive Memories: Orma will remind you, "It was your son! You had a wonderful time together in Bangalore."<br/>

## Features
